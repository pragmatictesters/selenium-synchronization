# Selenium Synchronization Project

## 🚀 Introduction
This project is dedicated to mastering synchronization strategies in Selenium. Our goal is to build a comprehensive set of techniques and best practices for handling synchronization challenges in automated testing.

### 📚 Project Scope
- Cover a wide range of synchronization techniques, including built-in and custom approaches.
- Develop custom Expected Conditions to handle scenarios not covered by Selenium’s built-in options.
- Demonstrate each technique through real-world examples and web pages specifically designed for showcasing synchronization challenges.
- Maintain thorough and structured Wiki documentation to guide users through the implementation and usage of each synchronization strategy.

### 🌐 Demo Web Pages
We will create and host demo web pages to showcase practical examples and demonstrate the application of different synchronization techniques.

Stay tuned as we continually add new techniques and improve the documentation to make synchronization easier and more reliable for Selenium testers!
